This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Brief
An offshoot of a common javascript tic-tac-toe application, created using typescript to demonstrate knowledge of the language, and to allow unit testing.


## User Guide:
Open the URL, Play tic-tac-toe - simple!

For more advanced observations:

Source code of the application can be found within src -> app.tsx, with tests being found in App.test.tsx.
